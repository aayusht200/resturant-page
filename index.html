                <h1>Chole</h1>
                <h2>What is Chole?</h2>
                <p>
                    Chole refers to an Indian chickpeas curry, especially popular in northern
                    parts of India. Chole is made with soaking chickpeas (also known as
                    garbanzo beans) overnight and then cooking them with onions, tomatoes and
                    spices to make this really flavorful curry. There are many ways in which
                    you can make chole, and there’s no really right or wrong way of making
                    them. Some people make chole without tomatoes, some make them without
                    onions. Some people use basic spices in their chole while others use
                    “chole masala” which is a special blend of spices. No two houses in India
                    will probably have the same recipe for chole. I know they were made
                    differently in my house compared to how they were made in my husband’s
                    house. But the base of the dish remains the same.
